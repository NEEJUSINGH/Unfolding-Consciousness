# vipassana-as-i-learn

*A quiet, non-scholarly walk through the Dharma — barefoot, wondering — not as teachings, but as lived questions.*

## About This Project

This is not a Buddhist textbook.  
This is not a complete guide.  
This is simply a collection of personal notes, reflections, and understandings gathered as I walk the path of **Vipassana** and **Buddhist inquiry**.

These lessons are not definitive answers — they are questions I’ve lived with, moments I’ve paused for, and fragments of clarity I’ve tried to gather along the way.

I am not a teacher. Just a fellow traveler.  
If this helps you — even a little — then I’m glad we crossed paths.

May it help you befriend yourself a little more.
