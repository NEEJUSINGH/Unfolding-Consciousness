# Unfolding Consciousness 
  **This is not a teaching. It’s the listening.**

*A quiet, non-scholarly walk through the Dharma — barefoot, wondering — not as teachings, but as lived questions.*

## About This Project

This is a living notebook of reflections — drawn from Buddhist and Hindu traditions, modern psychology, and my own practice.  

Each thread is an attempt to notice, name, and gently understand the layers of mind, emotion, habit, and awareness.

I write to make sense of what I feel.  
I write not to instruct, but to unfold — with you.

🪷 _Neeju Singh_

This is not a Buddhist textbook.  
This is not a complete guide.  
This is simply a collection of personal notes, reflections, and understandings gathered as I walk the path of Vipassana and Buddhist inquiry.

These lessons are not definitive answers — they are questions I’ve lived with, moments I’ve paused for, and fragments of clarity I’ve tried to gather along the way.

I am not a teacher. Just a fellow traveler.  
If this helps you — even a little — then I’m glad we crossed paths.

Please don’t treat this as a scholarly resource.
