|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **विज्ञाण**         | Viññāṇa                   | Consciousness / Knowing / discernment                              | The knowing or awareness that arises with a sense base and object. It’s momentary, conditioned, and not-self. It arises and ceases based on contact. |
| **चित्त**           | Citta                     | Mind-heart; thought and emotion center                              | The core of experience; a moment of consciousness itself. In some contexts, it refers to the emotional, ethical quality of mind — loving, agitated, calm, etc. |
| **मनो**            | Mano                      | Mind faculty (thinking); cognition, memory, intention               | The thinking or cognitive aspect of mind. It processes sense data and generates mental responses. Often distinguished from citta. |
| **खन्ध**           | Khandha                   | Aggregate, component of experience                                  | The five components that make up what we call a person: form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness (viññāṇa). None of them are self. |
| **संखार**          | Saṅkhāra                  | Mental formations; volitional constructs / volitions               | Volitional activities or conditioned tendencies. Includes thoughts, habits, emotions — all fabrications created by the mind. |
| **नामरूप**         | Nāma-Rūpa                 | Name and Form (mind and body)                                       | The psycho-physical pair: 'Nāma' is mental factors (feeling, perception, intention, contact, attention), and 'Rūpa' is material form. Together they form the individual being. |
| **पटिच्चसमुप्पाद** | Paṭiccasamuppāda          | Dependent Origination; conditional arising                          | The core doctrine of conditionality. Nothing arises independently — every phenomenon is conditioned by others, forming a cycle of birth and suffering. |

| **अनत्त**           | Anattā                    | Not-self, selfless                                                  | One of the three characteristics of existence. There is no unchanging, independent self behind thoughts, feelings, or body. Clinging to self creates suffering. |
| **निब्बान**         | Nibbāna                   | Nirvāṇa / Liberation / Unbinding / extinguishing                   | The unbinding or extinguishing of craving, aversion, and ignorance. It’s the end of the cycle of birth and death — not a place but a state of liberation. |
